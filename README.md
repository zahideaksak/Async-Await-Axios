# Async-Await-Axios

This project showcases the use of `async/await` syntax in React for handling asynchronous operations and utilizes the `axios` library for making HTTP requests.

## Features

- The fetchData.js file contains the `getUserAndPost` function to fetch user and post data.
- The app.js file performs a sample asynchronous data retrieval using the getUserAndPost function.
